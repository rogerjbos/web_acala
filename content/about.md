This site hosts reports for [Karura - The DeFi Hub of Kusama](https://acala.network/karura).

The report shows a dashboard followed by a chart of the activity over the past 8 days for each of the following four measures:

* Active Users
* Number of trades
* Average trades per user
* Trading Volume

Each dashboard and chart compares the latest day's swap activity to the prior 7-day average, coloring the box green (success), yellow (warning), or red (danger). If the latest day's activity is above the 7-day average (a ratio of 1.0 or above), the box is green. If the ratio is below 0.5, it is red. Otherwise it is yellow.

These dashboards are available at the aggregate level and for each trading pair.

The report is run daily at 5 past midnight UTC.

The R source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/karura-reports).
